I'm a current graduate student at Columbia University studying Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences looking forward for the next stop in my journey after graduating in May of 2022. Beginning my academic career in international politics at the Pennsylvania State University, I have a robust foundation in the social sciences. Data became the key to understanding these social sciences at its core. We need data to analyze our information, visualize relationships, and predict future trends. But what I love most about data is how applicable it is to almost any industry. 

My goal after graduation is to become a data analyst for entertainment, social media, or fashion brands where I can use data to enhance the work flow and develop products that most fit the current market. Hopefully in the long-run, I hope to fulfill my passion for social justice by becoming a public official and a role model for the Asian-American community that I represent. Until then, you can find me wandering around the city with my AirPods in as I ride the rhythm to some new music.

So excited to find out where my destination is! Thanks for stumbling across. :)
